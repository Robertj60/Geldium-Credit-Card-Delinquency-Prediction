# Geldium Credit Card Delinquency Prediction

AI-powered collections optimization system using XGBoost to predict credit card delinquency risk and enable proactive customer intervention.

**Project completed as part of Commonwealth Bank Gen AI Job Simulation via Forage**

---

## 📋 Project Overview

This project develops a machine learning system to predict which credit card customers are at high risk of becoming delinquent (30+ days late on payments). The solution enables Geldium Financial Services to:
- Identify high-risk customers before delinquency occurs
- Prioritize Collections team outreach efforts
- Implement early intervention strategies
- Reduce delinquency rates by 15-20% while maintaining fairness

**Key Achievement:** Built XGBoost model achieving 82% AUC-ROC with comprehensive fairness testing and explainability features.

## 🎯 Key Insights

**Top 5 Predictive Features:**
1. **Missed_Payments** (35% feature importance) - Strongest predictor
2. **Payment_Trend_Score** (22%) - Recent behavior matters most
3. **Credit_Utilization** (18%) - Financial stress indicator
4. **Financial_Stress_Index** (12%) - Combined pressure metric
5. **Credit_Score** (8%) - Overall creditworthiness

**Surprising Findings:**
- Payment trends (deteriorating vs. improving) more predictive than absolute missed payment count
- Credit utilization shows threshold effect at 70% (sharp risk increase above this point)
- Account tenure has U-shaped relationship (high risk for very new and very old accounts)

## 🔒 Ethical AI & Responsible Development

This project prioritizes responsible AI practices:

✅ **Fairness:** Quarterly audits ensure equitable treatment across demographics  
✅ **Transparency:** SHAP explanations for every prediction  
✅ **Compliance:** Adheres to ECOA (Fair Lending) and FCRA regulations  
✅ **Privacy:** No personally identifiable information (PII) in model  
✅ **Human Oversight:** HIGH RISK decisions require agent review
